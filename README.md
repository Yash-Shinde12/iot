IoT-based Gas Detection System with AI Integration
This project involves building an IoT-based gas detection system using an MQ2 sensor to monitor gas levels and trigger safety mechanisms. The system is equipped with a servo motor for valve control, fans for ventilation, and a buzzer for alarms, all integrated with the Blynk app for real-time monitoring and alerts.

Key Features:
Gas Detection: The MQ2 sensor detects gas levels, triggering alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
AI Integration: Machine learning models process sensor data to predict anomalies or detect abnormal behavior, such as gas leakage.
IoT Connectivity: The system uses the ESP8266 to send sensor data to ThingSpeak and Blynk for cloud storage and real-time monitoring.
Safety Mechanisms: The system activates safety measures like fans, LED indicators, and a servo-controlled valve to respond to detected gas levels.
Data Logging: The sensor data is logged on ThingSpeak for analysis and predictive insights.
Technologies Used:
Hardware: ESP8266, MQ2 Gas Sensor, HX711 Load Cell, Servo Motor, Buzzer, Relay, and LED indicators.
Software: Arduino IDE, Blynk, ThingSpeak, Machine Learning models (Python), and IoT-based communication protocols.
How It Works:
Gas Sensor Monitoring: The MQ2 sensor continuously monitors the gas levels.
AI Processing: Sensor data is processed by a machine learning model to identify potential gas leakage or irregularities.
Action Triggers: If dangerous gas levels are detected, the system activates safety mechanisms (fans, buzzer, and valve).
Remote Monitoring: Users can monitor and receive alerts via the Blynk app, ensuring they are notified of any issues in real-time.
